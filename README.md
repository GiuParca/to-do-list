<h1>To-do list</h1>
<p><strong>Purpose of the project:</strong><br>
To improve knowledge in JavaScript elements, DOM manipulation, and event handling.</p>
<h2>Main Features:</h2>

<ul>
<li>A To-Do List dynamically updated based on user interactions.</li>
<li>An intuitive user interface</li>
<li>Tasks are organized in a table, where it is possible to mark them as completed or remove them</li>
</ul>

<h2>What I&#39;ve learned:</h2>
<p>This exercise is part of my goal to put my web development knowledge into practice and understand the synergy between JavaScript, HTML, and CSS in creating dynamic experiences.</p>
<p>Through DOM manipulation in JavaScript, I handled user interactions, task entries, and real-time updates. I also focused on making it visually attractive and easy to use with the touch of CSS.</p>
